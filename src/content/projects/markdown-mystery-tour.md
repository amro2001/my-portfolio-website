MUNRoom not only simplifies the room rental process but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration among its users through integrated messaging features!

- Users can form and join groups to interact with like-minded people while looking for rooms, easing collaboration and improving the entire experience.

- Users manage their groups through invitations and approvals, providing privacy and control. Group creation requires invitations, and members must accept invitations to join.

- Renters have the flexibility to be part of multiple groups simultaneously, facilitating their exploration of various room rental options.

- Users can view and request to join other groups, and approval is subject to the consent of all current group members.

The platform also facilitates direct communication between renters and owners, enabling seamless scheduling, inquiries, and negotiations.

- Each group has its own dedicated chat functionality. Groups are structured to offer two distinct types of chats: the group chat for members to engage in discussions and coordination within the group, and separate chats designed for direct communication with landlords based on a listing.

- The group chat serves as a collaborative platform for members to share information, ask questions, and coordinate their room search efforts.

- The landlord-specific chat feature allows members to engage in private conversations with property owners. The landlord will be able to see the chats grouped by their different listings.
