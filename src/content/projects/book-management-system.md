Our book management system is a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing personal book collections. Whether it's a personal book collection or a large organizational library, our book management system provides a robust and user-friendly solution for efficient book management. Developed using the Java programming language and JavaFX framework, the system provides a professional and modern graphical user interface that is intuitive and easy to use. The application also offers users the ability to choose between SQLite or MySQL as the database backend in order to allow flexibility in database selection.

With either database, the system stores and manages comprehensive information about books, including their title, author, ISBN, location, genre, format, and additional information. Users can quickly and easily add new books to the system, or search for books using various search parameters such as ISBN, title, author etc. In addition to basic search functionality, the system also offers advanced search and browse by field capabilities allowing users to efficiently locate the desired books. Furthermore, users can conveniently modify or delete their book by double-clicking on the book from the search results, providing a seamless and efficient way to manage their book collections.
