Crafted a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe application with a streamlined architecture, leveraging classes like TicTacToeApplication, ConsoleRunner, Game, Board, GameStatus, Move, and AI interface, along with SmartAI and DumbAI implementations. The application allows users to input coordinates for moves, employs java.util.Scanner for parsing, and features a random move selection strategy for DumbAI. The design prioritizes immutability, ensuring safety in sharing Board objects, and showcases adept use of UML for system visualization.
