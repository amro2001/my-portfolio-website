As a collaborative effort within a skilled team, I actively contributed to the development of a C++ console-based application with a primary focus on eCommerce inventory management. This comprehensive application offers a set of vital functions, enhancing the efficiency and organization of inventory-related tasks.

### Key Features:

**Inventory Management:**

Add New Item: Facilitates the addition of new products to the inventory.
Remove Item: Allows for the removal of items from the inventory.
Count Certain Item: Enables counting the quantity of a specific item.
Sorting Items: Implements sorting mechanisms based on expiration date or price.
Display by Category: Provides the ability to display items belonging to a particular category, such as dairy products.
Customer History:

Customer Data Management: Incorporates a customer history function, adding customers to the data structure. Automatically removes the oldest customer when the data structure reaches its limit.

**Additional Implementations:**
- Data storage in a JSON file on the hard disk.
- Data retrieval from a JSON file, enhancing data persistence.
